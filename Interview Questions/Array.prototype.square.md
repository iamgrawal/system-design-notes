Implement a custom `Array` function, `Array.prototype.square()` which creates a **new** array with the results of squaring every element within the array the `.square()` method is called on.

## Examples

[-2].square(); // [4]

[1, 2, 3, 4].square(); // [1, 4, 9, 16]

## Notes

- The original array should not be modified.
- Assume that the array only contains numbers.
- Assume that the array will not be sparse, e.g. `[1, 2, , 4]`.
