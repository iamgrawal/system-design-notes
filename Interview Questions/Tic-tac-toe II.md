> Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players who take turns making space in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in playing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

Traditionally, tic-tac-toe uses a 3 x 3 grid. In this problem, build an advanced version of a tic-tac-toe game that has N x N cells on the board and needs M marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row to win.

The following diagram shows an example game where N = 5 and M = 4.

## Requirements

- Players can take turns to place an X or a O on an N x N board.
- A player wins if M of their marks are in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
- Display the current game status at the top: whose turn it is, winner (if any), or draw.
- Add a "Reset" button to allow the game to be restarted at any time.
