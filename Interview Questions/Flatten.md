Implement a function `flatten` that returns a newly-created array with all sub-array elements concatenated recursively into a single level.

## Examples

// Single-level arrays are unaffected.

flatten([1, 2, 3]); // [1, 2, 3]

// Inner arrays are flattened into a single level.

flatten([1, [2, 3]]); // [1, 2, 3]

flatten([

  [1, 2],

  [3, 4],

]); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Flattens recursively.

flatten([1, [2, [3, [4, [5]]]]]); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
