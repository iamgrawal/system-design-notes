Build a stopwatch widget which can measure how much time has passed. It shows the current timer and has two buttons underneath: "Start/Stop" and "Reset".

## Requirements

- Start/Stop Button: Starts/stops the timer depending on whether the timer is running.
- Reset: Resets the timer to 0 and stops the timer.
- The timer shows the number of seconds elapsed, down to the millisecond.
    - Clicking on the timer should start/stop the timer. The Start/Stop button's label should update accordingly as well.
    - It'd be a nice optional addition to format the time to display in hh:mm:ss:ms format.

You are free to exercise your creativity to style the appearance of the stopwatch. You can try out [Google's stopwatch widget](https://www.google.com/search?q=stopwatch) for inspiration and an example.
