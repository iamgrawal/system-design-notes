Implement a function `objectMap(obj, fn)` to return a new object containing the results of calling a provided function on every value in the object. The function `fn` is called with a single argument, the `value` that is being mapped/transformed.

## Examples

const double = (x) => x * 2;

objectMap({ foo: 1, bar: 2 }, double); // => { foo: 2, bar: 4}
