Implement a function `uniqueArray` that takes in an array and returns a duplicate-free version of the array where only the first occurrence of each element is kept. The order of result values is determined by the order they occur in the array.

## Examples

uniqueArray([1, 2, 3]); // [1, 2, 3]

uniqueArray([1, 1, 2]); // [1, 2]

uniqueArray([2, 1, 2]); // [2, 1]
