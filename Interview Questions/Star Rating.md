Create a star rating widget that allows users to select a rating value.

## Requirements

- The widget accepts two parameters: the maximum number of stars and the number of currently filled stars.
- When a star is clicked, it is filled along with all the stars to its left.
- When the user hovers over the stars, all the stars under the cursor and its left are filled.
    - The stars which need to be filled during hover take priority over existing filled state.
    - If the cursor leaves the widget and no new selection is made, the appropriate stars revert to the filled state before the hovering.
- Make the star rating widget reusable such that multiple instances can be rendered within the same page.

The star icons, both empty and filled, are provided to you as SVGs.

A `StarRating.js` skeleton component has been created for you. You are free to decide the props of `<StarRating />`.
